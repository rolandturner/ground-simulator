# ground-simulator
Simulated satellite ground station (for workshop use)

This simulates a simple antenna rotator that accepts P commands in the [rotctld protocol](http://hamlib.sourceforge.net/manuals/hamlib.html#rotctld-protocol) and displays a visualisation of where the rotator is pointing. It emulates the measured performance of [my (Roland's) WRAPS antenna rotator](https://rolandturner.com/2016/07/06/first-successful-satellite-tracker-test).

It was created for a [workshop](https://rolandturner.com/jsconf/) at [JSConf.Asia 2019](https://2019.jsconf.asia/) to allow participants something to test their code against before testing otudoors with the real rotator.
